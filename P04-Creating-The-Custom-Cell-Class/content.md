title: "Creating The Custom Cell Class"
slug: custom-cell-class

---

In order to access the custom cell's views in code, a custom class is needed.

We'll call this custom class `PostTableViewCell` and place all the methods related to keeping the cell up-to-date in here.

Start by creating the file.

> [action]
> Create a new file using the `Cocoa Touch Class` template.
>
> Select UITableViewCell from the `Subclass of:` dropdown and prepend `Post` to the class name to make the `Class:` field say, `PostTableViewCell`.
