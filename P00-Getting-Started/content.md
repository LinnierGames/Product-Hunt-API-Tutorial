A client wants to build a simple wrapper around Product Hunt using the PH API. The first feature the client wants you to implement is a feed that displays all of today's featured products. The client wants to keep the project lean and asks you explicitly not to use any dependencies or third party libraries.

# The App

**As a user...**

- I can browse the products featured today on Product Hunt by scrolling through the app’s main screen.
  - I see the product’s name, tagline, number of votes, and thumbnail.
- I can tap on each post to see its comments in descending order.

**As a client...**

- I can easily adjust what parts of the API are accessed by adjusting the parameters of a composable URL.
- I have a lean project that has no dependencies or third party libraries.
